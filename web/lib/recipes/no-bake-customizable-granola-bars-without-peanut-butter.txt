title: No-Bake Homemade Granola Bars (Without Peanut Butter)

ingredients:
- 1 Tbsp. chia seeds
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/4 cup grapeseed oil (or any other oil)
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 2 cups regular-rolled oats
- 2 cups puffed rice
- 2 cups of diced and chopped toppings/fillings. For this recipe, we are using dried strawberries, walnuts, and chocolate chips.

directions:
1. You want to make your chia binder first. In a small bowl, add the chia seeds to water and let it sit and swell for a few minutes.
2. Add the oil and maple syrup to a stovetop pot big enough for all the ingredients and let it melt together.
3. Add diced strawberries and walnuts to the pot and stir everything through.
4. Add the chia seed binder mix and mix well.
5. Remove the pot from the stove and add the oats and puffed rice and mix everything well.
6. Lastly, add the chocolate chips and mix it in.
7. Line a 9x13 baking dish (or a size that will accommodate your preferred bar thickness) with parchment paper.
8. Add the granola mix to the dish and flatten it out to your preferred thickness, compressing it as much as possible to make the bars stay together.
9. Store in the fridge for at least an hour, but preferable overnight and enjoy!
