title: Guilt-Free Eggplant Lasagna Packed with Plant-Based Protein

ingredients:
- 1/2 block firm or extra firm tofu (don’t pat dry)
- 1/4 cup Country Life Foods Lemon Herb Seasoning 
- 1 large eggplant, sliced 
- Pesto of your choice or see our recipe below
- Spinach 
- Marinara sauce 
- Salt
- Oil for drizzling 
- Panko breadcrumbs for topping sautéed with a bit of oil

directions:
1. Add sliced eggplant to a baking tray and sprinkle some salt to remove moisture and bitterness.
2. Leave for about 15 minutes, then pat dry and drizzle with oil. Flip, pat and drizzle more oil.
3. Bake at 400F for 20–25 minutes or until edges are soft. You can also pan fry the slices.
4. In the meantime, make your tofu ricotta by blending the tofu and seasoning in a blender.
5. Layer eggplant in a baking dish and then add pesto, tofu ricotta, spinach, and marinara.
6. Repeat layers until you use up all the eggplant and tofu ricotta. Top with vegan ricotta and marinara, vegan Parmesan, and panko bread crumbs.
7. Bake for 15–20 minutes until warm and the spinach is slightly wilted. Enjoy!
