2. While the oven is preheating, add all the ingredients together and mix (It should be very sticky). 
3. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. 
4. Scoop about 1-2 tablespoons into each cluster. An ice cream scoop works great. 
5. Make sure each cluster sticks together very well, or they won’t stick together while baking.

6. Bake for 15–20 minutes until they have darkened and become hard.
7. Take them out of the oven and set them aside to cool for 5 minutes to harden further.
