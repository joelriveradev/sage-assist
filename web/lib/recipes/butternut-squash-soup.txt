title: Butternut Squash Soup

ingredients:
- 3-4  butternut squash (3 if very large, 4 if smaller) 
- 4 cloves of garlic (minced) 
- 1 large yellow onion (chopped) 
- 4 carrots (chopped)
- 1 stick of butter
- 1 Tbs garlic powder
- 1 Tbs onion powder
- 1.5 tsp nutmeg
- 1 tsp salt, or as needed
- 8 cups of vegetable broth
- 2 cans coconut milk (full fat) 
- 4 Tbs maple syrup 

directions:
1. Cut the butternut squash in half and remove the seeds and pulp.
2. Drizzle with olive oil and salt. Bake at 375 for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until soft and golden.
3. Remove as much of the meat from the squash and set aside.
4. In a large pot, melt butter, and saut√© onion and garlic until translucent.
5. Add the broth, coconut milk, carrots, seasonings, etc., and bring the temperature up to medium heat.
6. Add all the squash, mix, and cook for 25 minutes or until carrots are soft and flavors have developed.
6. Take the soup in batches and blend in a blender until very smooth and velvety. Reserve one large ladle of soup to mix with the soup afterwards. This allows there to be a little bit of texture in the soup.
