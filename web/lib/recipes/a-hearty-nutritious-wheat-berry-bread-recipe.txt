title: A Hearty Nutritious Wheat Berry Bread Recipe

ingredients:
3/4 Cup of lukewarm water
- 1 Packet of Yeast (7g)
- 2 and a half Tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- 3 Tbsp Honey
- 1 1/2 Cups Bread Flour (*or all-purpose flour)
- 1 Tsp. Salt
- 1 Tsp. Cacao Powder
- Half a teaspoon of Nutmeg
- 1 1/2 Cups Wholewheat Flour
- 1 1/2 Cups Cooked Hard Red Wheat Berries **

directions:
To prepare the wheat berries
1. In a bowl, cover the wheat berries with water and soak overnight or for at least 5 hours.
2. Place the wheat berries in a pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to simmer for about 45 minutes, add more water if needed.
3. Drain and cool the cooked wheat berries. Roughly chop the wheat berries in a blender or by hand.

To make the bread
1. Pour the lukewarm water into a mixing bowl and add the yeast. Mix until dissolved, and rest for 5 minutes.
2. Add the olive oil and honey, and mix thoroughly.
3. Add 1 cup of the bread flour, salt, cacao powder and nutmeg. Mix to combine. 
Add the remaining bread flour and the wholewheat flour and mix to combine. At this point, you can use an electric mixer or the old-fashioned way, using your hands. 
4. Add the wheat berries and knead for about 5 to 8 minutes. If the dough is too dry, you can add a tablespoon of water at a time. 
5. Rest for 1.5 hours or until doubled in size.
6. Turn the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead to deflate. Shape the dough, place it in a 9 x 5 inch bread pan, and let it rise for 1.5 hours.
7. Preheat the oven to 350 F.
8. Bake the bread for 35â€“40 minutes. 

Notes:
* You can substitute bread flour with all-purpose flour, but take note that bread made with all-purpose flour may have a little less chew than those made with bread flour.
** You can use any wheat berries you prefer, although hard red, hard white, and soft white wheat berries often work the best for bread.
