title: Easy, No-Egg Zucchini Fritters With Ranch Dressing

ingredients:
- 3 cups grated zucchini, yellow or green, unpeeled, ends trimmed (use large holes of a standard grater)
- 1 Tbsp. sesame tahini
- 3/4 to 1 cup chickpea flour
- 1 tsp. dry mustard (optional)
- 1 tsp. cayenne pepper
- 1 Tbsp. lemon juice
- 3-4 Tbsp. sliced green onions with green stalk
- 1/2 tsp. sea salt
- Ranch dressing with our new ranch seasoning blend

directions:
1. Start by grating the zucchini into a bowl.
2. Add the tahini and chickpea flour and mix it well.
3. Add the mustard, cayenne pepper, and lemon juice.
4. Stir the mixture well and let it stand for 5-10 minutes so the chickpea flour can absorb the moisture from the zucchini and become the binder ingredient for the fritters.
5. While that is sitting, make your ranch dressing. Get the recipe here!
6. Add olive oil to a skillet and bring to medium heat.
7. With a spoon or spatula, scoop about a palm-size of the fritter mixture, add it to the pan, and brown for 3-4 minutes on each side.
8. Top with the ranch dressing and serve immediately!
