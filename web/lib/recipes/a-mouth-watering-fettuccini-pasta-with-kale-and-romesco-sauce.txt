- 2 oven-roasted red peppers
- 5 cloves of garlic
- 1 cup raw almonds
- 2 Tbs olive oil
- 1 Tbs Italian Seasoning

3. In a sauté pan, heat olive oil and garlic. Sauté for 2 minutes, then add kale and pepper flakes. Mix and cook for 5 minutes, then set aside.
4. In a food processor, blend all sauce ingredients, including roasted peppers. Blend until well mixed.
5. Add cooked pasta to the kale and add sauce. Toss until all is mixed.
6. Serve with a sprinkle of nutritional yeast flakes, chopped parsley, and/or extra red pepper flakes if desired. Enjoy!!
